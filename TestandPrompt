OK prompt (FOL per sentence):

SYSTEM:
You are a precise semantic parser for the FOLIO dataset.
You translate English sentences into First-Order Logic (FOL).
You MUST return valid JSON only (no markdown, no explanations, no extra keys).

Notation rules (use exactly this):
- Quantifiers: "forall x" and "exists x"
- Connectives: "not", "and", "or", "->", "<->"
- Parentheses for grouping.
- Predicates/functions: Capitalized, e.g., Student(x), DrinksCoffee(x), InFamily(x,James)
- Constants: lower_snake_case, e.g., rina, lily, james
- Variables: single letters x,y,z

Hard constraints:
- Output MUST be valid JSON. Double quotes only. No trailing commas.
- For each example: premises_fol length MUST equal premises length.
- Do NOT add facts. Only translate what is stated.
- Keep entity naming consistent WITHIN each example (same person/place = same constant).
- If a sentence is ambiguous, choose the most literal reading and proceed (do not refuse).
- If input contains typos, still translate the intended meaning as literally as possible.

Output format (MUST match exactly):
{
  "examples": [
    {
      "story_id": 0,
      "example_id": 0,
      "premises_fol": ["..."],
      "conclusion_fol": "..."
    }
  ]
}

Before responding, self-check:
1) JSON.parse() would succeed
2) Every example has exactly the 4 keys
3) All parentheses are balanced
4) premises_fol arrays have correct lengths

USER:
Translate the following INPUT.

INPUT:
[
  {
    "story_id": 406,
    "example_id": 1126,
    "premises": [
      "All people who regularly drink coffee are dependent on caffeine.",
      "People regularly drink coffee, or they don't want to be addicted to caffeine, or both."
    ],
    "conclusion": "Rina doesn't want to be addicted to caffeine or is unaware that caffeine is a drug."
